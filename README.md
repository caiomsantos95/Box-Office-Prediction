# Box Office Prediction
This project was developed by Matheus and me as part of our coursework. We aimed to predict movie box office revenues using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
We began by web scraping data from IMDb, focusing on various movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, budget, and release date. Using this data, we trained several machine learning models to forecast box office performance. While our predictions didn't achieve high accuracy, the project provided valuable insights into the challenges of predictive modeling in the entertainment industry.

## Methodology
### Data Collection: We utilized web scraping tools to gather a dataset of movies from IMDb, capturing features like genre, cast, director, budget, and release date.

### Data Preprocessing: The collected data underwent cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables, ensuring suitability for model training.

### Feature Engineering: We explored various features to determine their impact on box office revenue, including:

**Budget:** Financial investment in the movie.
**Cast and Crew Popularity:** Measured by the number of previous successful projects.
**Genre:** Categorical classification of the movie.
**Release Timing:** Season or month of release.
**Model Training:** We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to predict box office revenue.

**Evaluation:** Model performance was assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Despite thorough efforts, the models exhibited limited predictive power, highlighting the complexity of forecasting box office success.

## Results and Insights
Our analysis revealed that certain features, like budget and release timing, have a notable correlation with box office revenue. However, the unpredictability of audience reception and external factors contribute to the challenges in making accurate predictions.
